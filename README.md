# R_Descriptive Statistics & Unique Metrics_Ousean Internship Application Form

## Find Descriptive Statistics and Unique Metrics

After completing the EDA, a data scientist will then calculate descriptive statistics and unique metrics. Descriptive Statistics is a method of systematically collecting, processing, presenting, and explaining data so that the information conveyed is easy to understand and useful for the audience. Meanwhile, Unique Metrics is a measurement method that calculates the number of different entities in a dataset without including duplicates.

I used a dataset titled “Internship Application Form (Answers)” provided by the Ousean Data Analyst Workshop (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N9DLCNtacpvhg-bIOwnbk63nxHC-5S81/edit?gid=697004839# gid=697004839). This data is used to determine the identity, interests, and abilities of participants who apply for internships at Ousean.

Goals :
1. Knowing descriptive statistics Total participants, Gender, Province of origin, Institution, Department of choice
2. Knowing unique metrics such as the male-to-female ratio per department, as well as participant distribution per city and skill level

Insights:
1. The majority of participants were women, accounting for 73%, while men accounted for only 27% of the total.
2. Jawa Barat is the province with the highest number of participants, followed by Jawa Timur, Jawa Tengah, Banten, DKI Jakarta, and others.
3. The number of participants per institution did not differ greatly from one another, with Universitas Diponegoro and Universitas Brawijaya having the highest numbers.
4. 'Administration and Finance' and ‘Human Resource and Development (HRD)’ are the most popular departments.

After this data has been processed and visualized, the information provided can be used to support marketing improvements for less popular departments, open new branches in strategic areas, and improve the quality of learning based on the skills most desired by applicants.
